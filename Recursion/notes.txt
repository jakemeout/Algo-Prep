What is Recursion?

A process (a function in our case) that calls it self. 
Examples: 
    - JSON.parse / JSON.stringify
    - document.getElementById and DOM traversal algorithms
    - Object traversal
    - Complex data structure traversal 
    - Sometimes cleaner alternative to iteration


Call Stack

    - Data structure called a stack
    - When a function is invoked it is placed on top (pushed)
    - When js sees the return keyword the compiler removes it from the stack (pop)


Game Plan for recursive functions 1 parts

    1. Different Input - Invoking the function over and over
    2. Base case - where the recursion stops
