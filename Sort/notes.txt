First review the built in Array.sort() method 

String Unicode Code Points
    - Unicode is used to represent strings 
    - Every item in the array is converted to a string and then the unicode value of that is taken and then it is sorted

How it works:
The built-in sort method accepts an optional comparator function
You can use this comparator function to tell JavaScript how you want it to sort
The comparator looks at pairs of elements (a and b), determines their sort order based on the return value
If it returns a negative number, a should come before b
If it returns a positive number, a should come after b,
If it returns 0, a and b are the same as far as the sort is concerned


Bubble sort:
 - Not that efficient, but good to help understand how other algorithms improve upon it.  
 - Swapping two values on first pass in the areas (sinking sort - pessimistic). Bubbling the largest value until the top.
  - Eventually bubbles the largest item on top.

  PsuedoCode: Bubblesort
- Start looping with a variable called i the end of the array towards the beginning
- Start an inner loop with a variable called j from the beginning until i - 1
- If arr[j] is greater than arr[j+1], swap those two values!
- Return the sorted array


           Time best Complexity   Time Complexity Average  Space Complexity
Bubble      O(n)                 O(n^2)                   O(1)
Insertion   O(n)                 O(n^2)                   O(1)
Selection   O(n^2)               O(n^2)                   O(1)




Complicated Sorts:

Merged Sorts:
  -Split up the array into individual arrays
  -Merge and sort the arrays until you get back to 1 array
