// Here are the ground rules:
//     Try to keep your answers brief.
//     The quiz is open book, open internet, but no other collaboration is allowed.
//     Please don't post questions or answers on the public internet. For example, don't put your answers in a public GitHub repo.
//     You may use any programming languages you wish (e.g. C, Ruby, Java, Clojure, etc.) to illustrate your answers.
//     If there is an existing function or operator built into your environment that implements the correct answer (or something substantially similar), please do not use that.
//     It's important that you answer all the questions correctly.
// Good luck!

// 1. Given a one dimensional array of data write a function that returns a new array with the data reversed. Don't just use the reverse function that is built into your environment.
// 2. Write a quick and dirty program (not just a function) to print a count of all the different "words" in a text file. Use any reasonable definition of word that makes logical sense or makes your job easy.
// The output should be sorted like this:
// ```
// 17 a
// 14 the
// 9 of
// 9 in
// 8 com
// 7 you
// 7 that
// 7 social
// 6 to
// ```
// For this input file, the word "a" occurred 17 times, "the" 14 times, etc.
// 3. Write a function that returns M random non-negative integers less than some value N, where M and N are arbitrary integers, and each output integer is unique.
// 4. Given a one dimensional array of data write a function that return M random elements of that array. Each element must be from a different position in the array. Don't just use the sample function that is built into your environment.
// 5. Given two strings, s and t , write a function that tests whether t is a substring contained within s. The function should return the integer index within s of the first occurrence of t, or -1 if no match is found. You may not use regular expressions in your solution (unless you also implement the regex library).


// 6. Consider a directed graph of small non-negative integers where each integer is less than 60,000 and each integer is unique. In this case,
// a directed graph is a data structure where a node is represented by a unique integer and each node has zero or more child nodes. As above, don't just use an existing graph library.
// - Write a function that creates a node in a graph.
//  - Write a function that inserts a node as a child of another node.
//  - These functions should not allow cycles to be created. That is, a node may not directly or indirectly point to itself.
// - Write a function to print out a graph

// Here is a simple example graph without cycles:
// 1 -> 2, 3, 4
// 2 -> 5
// 3 -> 6
// 4 -> 3, 6
// 5 -> 6
// 6 -> No children
