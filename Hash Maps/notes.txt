Linear Probing

Linear probing involves storing one thing in each position and looking ahead in an empty space to store something.


Separate Chaining:
    - Putting the results in a nested array 

Adjacency Matrix:
    - Can take up more space
    - slower to iterate
    - Faster to lookup edges

Adjacency List:
    - can take up less space
    - faster to iterate over edges
    - Can be slower to look up edges
    - Most real world data is sparce, tons of nodes lots of vertices which works best in an adjecency list
            - A matrix would be massive with a large data set
